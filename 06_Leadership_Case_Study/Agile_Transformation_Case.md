# 🦁 Leadership Case Study: Transforming a Delivery Squad

**Context:** Managing a 25-member Engineering & Product team delivering Regulatory Risk Platforms (OFSAA) for a Tier-1 Bank.

## 1. The Situation (The "Before" State)
* **Morale:** Low. Engineers felt like "feature factories."
* **Process:** Waterfall. Requirements were thrown over the wall by consultants.
* **Metric:** Release cycles were **6 months** long. Bug density was high (15 critical bugs per release).

## 2. The Intervention (My Actions)

### A. The "Why" Meeting
I gathered the team (Consultants + Engineers) and shifted the goal from "Billing Hours" to "System Stability." I explained *why* their code matters (preventing bank failure).

### B. Implementation of "True Agile"
* **Shift:** Moved from 6-month cycles to **2-week Sprints**.
* **Ritual:** Instituted a strict 15-min daily standup focused on "Blockers," not status updates.
* **Protection:** I acted as a "Shield," rejecting ad-hoc client requests that disturbed the sprint scope.

### C. The "Product Trio" Structure
I restructured the 25 people into 3 "Pods." Each Pod had:
* 1 Lead Engineer
* 1 Functional Consultant
* 1 QA
* *Result:* Reduced decision latency. Engineers didn't have to wait for "The Manager" to approve everything.

## 3. The Result (Quantitative Impact)
* **Velocity:** Feature delivery speed increased by **20%** within 4 months.
* **Quality:** Critical bugs dropped from 15 to **3** per release (80% reduction).
* **Culture:** eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score) rose significantly; attrition dropped to zero for 12 months.

## 4. Retrospective / Learnings
* **Mistake:** Initially, I tried to micromanage the Jira board.
* **Correction:** I learned to step back and let the Tech Leads own the "How," while I owned the "What" and "Why."
